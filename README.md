<u>Inspiration:</u> The project is inspired by the need to save time. Providing its users with concise 
summaries which enable them to grasp the information quickly from lengthy videos without 
having to go over the entire thing is a major tool of convenience especially for those who are 
expected to watch them but don't want to. 
 
<u>Background info:</u> Such summarization tools exist and they take in audio transcripts to generate 
their output summaries based on how much in detail the user requires. Very few resources that 
summarize videos based on frame and images alone exist
